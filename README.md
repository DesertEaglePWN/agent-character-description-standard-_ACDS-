# Agent Character Description Standard (ACDS)
A public project to help standardize and unify character formats for AI agents, including but not limited to those used for Character agents.

Agent Character Description Standard can be thought of as an openly available spiritual successor to the TavernAI Character Card Spec V2 (https://github.com/malfoyslastname/character-card-spec-v2/tree/main) with affordances for AutoGen and non-roleplay agents.
